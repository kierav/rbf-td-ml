Radial Basis Function Time Domain (RBF-TD) implementations in 2-D space + time

Based on paper https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-019-01065-3
and code from https://github.com/DylanAbrahamsen/RBF-TD

Extension to 2-D space + time as well as options to optimize weights including trained machine learning models, L1-minimization or L2-minimization

Relies on node generation algorithm code https://github.com/kierav/node_generation
